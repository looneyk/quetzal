if coordinate requires exponential notation, it's 0
clean up coordinates when target is model, these values make no sense there
tolerance/precision algorithm applied to coordinates?


Handle the case where an existing group is being specified in the context of a different material
see notes in read_obj and write_obj in model/obj_io.hpp

set_material(s) may need to do caching, not just writing

how to write material with no group? blank group/surface name?

Writer may need to cache material for the above, actual write with o or g

Mesh materials property is a space separated list of materials files, same as for mtllib
Material loading thus preserves the order of material files,
but not any association between material usage and library as the first material with a given name will be the one used even if it appears in separate files
Is this something that even needs to be taken into account?

Do we really want to throw exceptions on material syntax errors?
Just log and ignore, loading whatever we can?
