stl read
handling of default surface name? default flag, otherwise write it out?
maybe just use submesh name with suffix? no, I really prefer not to introduce new names
submesh name is available in text
binary submesh name can be given base filename
no surface name in either


strict text read:
    vectors have 3 components
    loops have 3 points
    facets have 1 loop
    solid and endsolid names match
may not be line oriented, so more general token parsing/consumption is necessary

reading has to be into new Submesh of Mesh
writing, however, can apply to both Mesh and Submesh

this implementation currently allows faces with more than 3 vertices, creates polygonal face instead of triangle
