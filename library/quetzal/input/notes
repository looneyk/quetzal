where would xbox or similar controllers fit in?


make sure that new input device types can be registered and used dynamically (InputDevice interface)


device sets, linked devices to allow for multiple sets of keyboard/mouse combinations for example
a device set, not a device would have a selected widget (not necressarily true for other properties though)

should mouse functionality be exposed through separate (paired?) pointer and key devices?

does a distinction really need to be made between pointer and key devices?
all devices are simply allowed to produce all types of input events
