check boost mpl

Just implement your image loader in terms of std::istream, and then use different streambufs for your different sources. 


Color does too much with hsl and yuv

Should Serial be in io or device? (or just separate?)
device wrapped by IO?
device used as template parameter? analogously filesystem and memory devices ... (device manager)
IO might mean just character stream devices
Input<device>, Output<device>?
