function to add to existing or newly created defs element
how to indicate whether to add element at current position or to defs?
have a separate defs version which wraps the current position version
*single defs function with callback
*untested

push curent element position
find defs element
if not exists, create it at beginning of svg element list
set defs to current element
add new defs child element (current function)
pop 


what's wrong with symbol position?


define styles
define attributes to be applied to all shapes (application of common style?)
allow for common styles/attributes by element type
no, just define styles externally and add a single attribute for it
